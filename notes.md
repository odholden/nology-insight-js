# Context

1. Explain what an API is, how it enabled the revolution in the web (Web 2.0, we're now on 4)
2. Show Google Maps working, as well as tweets embedded in a news story
3. Then show our app (finished, branch master), explain that its using the publicly available API from Google Maps to add extra value to a user. Compare with AirBnb - a multibillion dollar business that exists because of Web 2.0.

**Explain:** That was the context, now you're thinking wow sounds powerful, if only I could harness that....

Well the point is you can!

# Demonstration 

1. Introduce the code of the app - HTML, CSS, JS for data, style and functionality.
2. Branch 1 - Add Map, and complete the steps to implement the maps
3. Branch 2 - Finished version, show functionality thats been added since
4. Branch 3 - Debugging, three problems to solve as a group
